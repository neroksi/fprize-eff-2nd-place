# How to run
The training kernel is at notebooks/training.ipyng and inference is under notebooks/inference.ipynb.

## Working directory and paths configuration

To run the notebook at *notebooks/training.ipyng*, one needs to:  
 

- Create a folder called *data* which represents **DATA_ROOT** configs variable.  
    You should put the competition's data under *data/feedback-prize-effectiveness* and the 2021 competition's data under
    *data/feedback-prize-2021*.  

By the way, *you* can put these files anywhere you want but in that case you should set these params (see notebook):
- **TRAIN_CSV_PATH**
- **TRAIN_ROOT**

You could also need to set many other path related variables like: *MODEL_ROOT*, *OOF_DFs_ROOT* ... (see notebook).

## Efficiency track

The training for efficiency track is almost the same. You just have to discard the folding-related things, which is done in the *notebooks/training-efficiency.ipynb* file.
The inference kernel is strictly the same for efficiency and non-efficiency.
